        <h3>üìöHistory of Books</h3>
        <p>
            As early as 3,000 BC, the Sumerians were using pictograms or
            cuneiform writing on clay tablets. Egyptians began using papyrus
            scrolls at the same time to record history, philosophies, and
            stories. The first books were created around 500 BC as hand-written
            scrolls.

        <h3>‚ù§Ô∏èReading Is My Hobby</h3>
        <p>
            There are many benefits to reading, from learning new words to
            maintaining your mental health. There is nothing I love more than
            packing a lunch and spending a day outside at a park with a new
            book. My personal reading genre focuses on true crime and historical
            fiction, although I often throw a wildcard read in to change up the
            theme.
        </p>
        <p>
            My history with books began as soon as I knew how to read. My father
            would pay me $20 USD for every book I read. Needless to say, I took
            to the hobby very quickly, and after the first few books I read, a
            new deal was struck that did not involve monetary compensation. The
            first book I read focused on the history of Nostradamus which some
            may find odd due to my age at the time. However, ever since I was
            young I have been fascinated with history and those who played a
            crucial role early on. Since then, I have explored various reading
            genres despite naturally gravitating more towards crime novels. As
            an adult, I find reading helps me turn my mind off and escape to a
            place that is built in my mind.
        </p>

            Ironically enough, my father wrote a book before he passed away
            which I am working on digitizing. The memoir chronicles his struggle
            with alcoholism, his journey to sobriety, and the importance of
            teaching your children about the disease.
